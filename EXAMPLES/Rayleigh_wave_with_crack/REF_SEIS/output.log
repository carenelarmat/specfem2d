 Mesh numbering:

   Total number of acoustic elements           =            0
   Total number of elastic/visco/poro elements =         1680

 Approximate total number of grid points in the mesh
 (with a few duplicates coming from MPI buffers):        27362

 Approximate number of acoustic degrees of freedom in the mesh:            0
 Approximate number of elastic degrees of freedom in the mesh:        54724
   (there are 2 degrees of freedom per point for elastic elements)

 Approximate total number of degrees of freedom in the mesh
 (sum of the two values above):        54724

  (for simplicity viscoelastic or poroelastic elements, if any,
   are counted as elastic in the above three estimates;
   in reality they have more degrees of freedom)

 Preparing initial field for plane wave source

 Implementing an analytical initial plane wave...


 *** calculation of the initial plane wave ***

 To change the initial plane wave, change source_type in DATA/SOURCE and use:
   1 or 4 - for a plane P wave
   2 or 5 - for a plane SV wave
   3      - for a Rayleigh wave

 Rayleigh wave introduced.

 angle source          =    0.0000000000000000


 It is not possible to have several materials with a plane wave, thus using the first material.
 This is not a homogenous model, it contains            3  materials
 but the plane wave initial and boundary fields
 are computed by analytical formulas for a homogenous model.
 Thus use at your own risk!

 mesh dimensions:
   x min/max =    0.00000000       19.0000000
   z min/max =    0.00000000       9.00000000

 Number of grid points =        13737

 You can modify the location of the initial plane wave by changing xs and zs in DATA/SOURCE.
    for instance: xs=   3.5000000000000000         zs=   9.0000000000000000       (zs can/should be the height of the free surface)

 *************
 We have to compute the initial field in the frequency domain
 and then convert it to the time domain (can be long... be patient...)

   left    =            0
